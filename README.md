# RailsAlchemy
RailsAlchemy transforms development raw text requirements into an up and running Rails application.<br>

Example:<br>
<code>$ python statAlchemy.py -r 'Every student belongs to a school. A school is managed by a director. Every director manages one or more teachers.' -d /tmp -e 'yes'</code><br>
